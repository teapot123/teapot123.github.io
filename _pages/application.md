I am looking for PhD students for 25'Fall and interns year-round! If you are interested in working with me, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFDUgS0Q6CiH2-SjztPRwPP4DxCED5THhKdTOgIP3fh4LSTw/viewform). While submitting the form is already sufficient, you are also welcome to reach out to me via email. I will read every email but please understand that I might not be able to respond to each of them due to time constraints.

If you are applying for CSE PhD for 25'Fall, application fee could be waived through attending the [PhD information sessions](https://engineering.washu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions/recruitment-schedule.html) under the Computer Science & Engineering category. 

For students looking for summer internships, please make sure to check out the [REU program](https://engineering.washu.edu/academics/undergraduate-research/international-student-research-internship-program.html), which has an application deadline of 11/13.
